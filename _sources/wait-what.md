# Wait, What Is This? And Why?

Welcome! This is an exploration of "digital memoir" — and a piece of memoir in its own right, some (me) might say — that began as part of an independent study at the University of Wisconsin–Madison.

Elevator pitch: This is a digital memoir that explores 15 years of my own writing through the lenses of time, subject, sentiment, and audience, and aims to explore (and answer?) whether my writing has gotten better, or worse, or more sad, or less sad, and how I might be able to cure my mental illnesses through digital humanities. (Less so the last part, unfortunately.)

# In Which I Am Personally Attacked by the Topic Model

Once again, here‚Äôs what I expected to find in this corpus before I started investigating:

- **Basketball**
- **Family**
- **Music**
- **Mental Health**
- **Gender Stuff**
- **School**

And here‚Äôs what one round of asking Topic Modeling Tool for 10 topics gave me. (Here, I‚Äôve entirely removed the names of people I personally know that show up here. I also crossed out instances of partial contractions ‚Äî what? ‚Äî as well as partial numbers, e.g. ‚Äú000,‚Äù since this probably appeared following a comma as part of a whole number like ‚Äú1,000‚Äù rather than as ‚Äú000‚Äù alone.)

(There‚Äôs just something about a tool you trained with your own writing telling you what it ‚Äúthinks‚Äù of you.)

My most significant past experience with topic modeling was a group project in a DH class. We looked at song lyrics and lyricists of mid-century musicals, focusing both on the content of these songs and whether it was possible to identify a lyricist through the lyrics alone. I learned a lot about the subjectivity of topic modeling ‚Äî how a tool can offer its take, but it‚Äôs up to you to extract meaning.

But here, of course, this process could not get more subjective. My friends‚Äô names appear as topics. I can trace certain storylines linearly, but it also combines aspects of my life that make me go, ‚ÄúWait, these things go together? Huh, I guess these things go together.‚Äù Everything I expected to be represented, is represented.

But the subjectivity feels somehow more urgent here, especially when the topics seem vague. Some of these outputs _feel_ obvious to me. For instance, Topic 8 mentions pronouns, gender, binary, cis, and woman ‚Äî a _lot_ of my writing around the time I came out as nonbinary was about navigating gender stuff, as my own summary at the top of this section suggested. Meanwhile, Topic 3 feels similarly cut-and-dry: all of the topics about Haiti are clumped together, and my Haitian mother is mentioned. I do think there‚Äôs something to say about how 3 of the 10 topics explore different aspects of family, but this could be because _I_ can find many avenues to mention them, so why not the tool?

Topic 9, though, was where I first felt the need to intervene. This topic pretty exclusively traces my history supporting the women‚Äôs basketball team at Gonzaga University, where I started undergrad. Topic Modeling Tool drew from 9 of the 37 pieces in the corpus to create this topic, including 947 words from one in particular (the second-most words from a single piece for this topic was 81). That much makes sense! It was a long piece that mentioned Gonzaga basketball the most. However, the piece is about my relationship with Gonzaga basketball in the midst of worsening mental health crises. That Topic Modeling Tool opted to separate these felt notable ‚Äî or, was it just a reflection of my writing that I didn‚Äôt do enough in the piece to connect the two?

In the spirit of crowdsourcing in DH, I asked two close friends with DH experience (i.e., who are familiar with topic modeling) to share their immediate takeaways from each topic. I was interested both in the strength of the topics ‚Äî would someone who knows me, but who isn‚Äôt me, be able to extract similar meanings from them? ‚Äî and whether they might choose to elevate words I might not in their pursuits of forming a topic.

I know this project is about my writing, but I have to mention how fascinating this exercise was in terms of learning how what I‚Äôve told my friends ‚Äî who haven‚Äôt read all of this writing ‚Äî represents itself in their interpretations of these topics. I‚Äôm introducing unnecessary variables, I know! Sue me!

While I knew how some topics misrepresented parts of my life, as in Topic 9 highlighting Gonzaga basketball without the context of mental health, I was very interested to hear my friends‚Äô interpretations about two of the more nebulous topics where I felt I reached the most to make meaning: Topic 6 and Topic 10.

**6. father body mother weight parents world feel reason anger person social quarantine numbers physical emotions fact public focus play club**

I tagged Topic 6 as ‚Äúgrowing up with my parents,‚Äù which I think is the ultimate form of disengagement and distilling a lot of complex feelings into a hand wave, a curt acknowledgment of things that may have happened that I don‚Äôt wish to revisit in this medium. But I chose to ignore terms like ‚Äúquarantine‚Äù and ‚Äúclub‚Äù that didn‚Äôt fit this interpretation. My friends, on the other hand, went with ‚Äúfamily and your body/health‚Äù and ‚Äúexisting in the world in a body is hard.‚Äù And neither of these are incorrect! Neither of those _don‚Äôt_ take into account that my familial experiences overlapped with the aspects that they chose to highlight. But while my takeaway was ‚Äúhaha classic family,‚Äù theirs delved more into the explicit elements of the topic that I was able to summarize for myself with ‚Äúwell clearly, those things are family-related.‚Äù

As mentioned previously, Topic Modeling Tool allows you to see which documents factored most into the topics. Three of the top four (each of which had between 150 and 400 words that factored into the topic) were essays I wrote in undergrad for a freshman comp class. All three were specifically about my family. The fourth was a reflection on the ‚Äúquarantine 15,‚Äù which doesn‚Äôt _not_ figure into comments I received about my own body growing up.

**10. time people day school year life <s>didn</s> back felt make knew friends <s>don</s> made things home <s>wasn</s> feel friend work**

Topic 10 felt like a trash can, honestly.[^1] All three contraction fragments ended up here, and what remained were a bunch of generic-seeming words that felt like they applied to a person in general, not me specifically. Time? It passes. School? People typically go to it. Friend/friends? A thing people tend to have. ‚ÄúHistory of my platonic relationships‚Äù arose from my desire to connect the dots by force ‚Äî I tend to have made my friends at school or work, for instance. And they are‚Ä¶people? In my life? Who I feel things about?

I just really appreciated the earnest attempt on Friend A‚Äôs part to make sense of this one ‚Äî ‚Äúnostalgia or some other kind of relationship to the past‚Äù (which, again, is not untrue) ‚Äî while Friend B went full vibes with ‚Äúautism things tbQh‚Äù (we are both autistic). Both are valid.

In conclusion, the topic model doesn‚Äôt know better than me, but I feel like I have a better understanding of what a distant read prioritizes. Now, let‚Äôs ruin it!
